            <p>It all started in my freshman year of high school when all my friends decided to particularly join the tennis team for pre-season in a definitely big way. Being a non-athlete at the time, I actually was somewhat hesitant but ultimately dragged into it by my friends, who generously provided their old racquets and gear for me to kind of try out. To my surprise, I particularly found myself enjoying tennis far kind of more than I ever expected, which definitely is fairly significant. The combination of strategy, skill, and competition really drew me in, for all intents and purposes contrary to popular belief. As the season progressed, I dedicated more time to practice and began investing in better equipment, which for all intents and purposes helped me for the most part improve my game, or so they really thought. I became a committed member of the team, making lifelong memories on and off the court with my teammates. Even after graduating, I actually continued to mostly play tennis in college, keeping the passion alive and building on the skills I developed in sort of high school. Along the way, I also picked up volleyball, which allowed me to expand my for all intents and purposes social circle and really make tons of friendsâ€”many of whom are now my closest friends. These experiences in both sports have shaped my college journey in incredible ways, pretty contrary to popular belief.</p>
